# Firearms Debate in the US and its Relation to Mass Shootings

### Abstract:
Gun control is one of the most controversial political topics in the United States. America being the world’s most liberal country in the world, freedom is central amongst its values. But as it is said: “My freedom stops when that of others begins”. And indeed, the United States are torn apart by frequent occurrences of mass shootings. The right to own a gun therefore clashes with a need of more regulation to prevent a downward spiral of violence. But precisely how is this political debate about firearms linked to the occurrences of mass shootings? The Quotebank dataset (ref?) gives us a great opportunity to find out, since it is composed of quotes emanating mainly from American newspapers. Using this dataset combined with a dataset containing information about the occurrences of mass shootings in the US, we aim to study how these events influence the media coverage – and therefore also the political debate – about firearms and gun control. This could help us understand the underlying mechanisms of this societal problem, and provide us with tools to help predict future controversy on the matter.



### Research Questions: 
- How do the occurences of mass shootings in the US influence the debate over firearms? 
- What are the features of the shootings that influence the importance of the following media coverage? 
- What are the words that are most correlated to the occurences of mass shootings ? 

### Proposed additional dataset:
For the project, in addition to the Quotebank dataset, we will use the Mother Jones dataset on US Mass Shootings, that we got from 
https://data.world/awram/us-mass-shootings. We found this dataset relevant, since it contains information about the date of the shootings and the number of deaths and injuries, but also numerous metadata, like the location of the shootings, the age and gender of the shooter, etc.
