# Firearms Debate in the US and its Relation to Mass Shootings

### Abstract:
Gun control is one of the most controversial political topics in the United States. America being one of the world’s most liberal countries in the world, freedom is central amongst its values. But some could say: “My freedom stops when that of others begins”. And indeed, the United States are torn apart by relatively frequent occurrences of mass shootings. The right to own a gun therefore clashes with a need of more regulation to prevent a downward spiral of violence. But precisely how is this political debate about firearms linked to the occurrences of mass shootings? This is what we intend to find out by analyzing quotes emanating from American newspapers provided by the Quotebank dataset. Using this dataset combined with another one containing information about the all the mass shootings in the US in our studied timeframe, we aim to study how these tragic events influence the media coverage – and therefore also the political debate – about firearms and gun control. This could help us understand the underlying mechanisms of this societal problem, and provide us with tools to help predict future controversy on the matter.

### Research Questions: 
- How do the occurences of mass shootings in the US influence the debate over firearms? 
- What features of the shootings (location, number of fatalities, weapon type/legality...) influence most the size of the following media coverage? For example, are shootings in more democrat states creating a larger media coverage and outrage afterwards? We would like to rank the features by influence on this matter.
- What are the words that are most correlated to the occurences of mass shootings? This would give us insight on how people are talking on the topic (is it more about dwelling on the victims or questionning the right to own a gun?).

### Proposed additional dataset:
For the project, in addition to the Quotebank dataset, we will use the **"Mother Jone's" dataset** on US Mass Shootings, that we got from 
https://data.world/awram/us-mass-shootings. Finding such a dataset was necessary for our project to be feasible. Indeed, it gives us basic information (e.g. date, number of fatalities) about each shooting that occured in the USA between 2015 and 2020, adding also some interesting features such as location, age and gender of the shooter, etc.

### Methods : 
- **Managing the size of the data**:<br> The Quotebank dataset's size does not let us work with it as a whole in a reasonnable way. Using Google Colab, we were able to link the dataset to Google Drive storage. We ran a code that would select only the quotes related to firearms and shootings, and save the corresponding rows to a new file. This way, we would get rid of the unecessary rows containing quotes who had no direct link to our study. 

- **Selecting the relevant quotes**:<br> For this milestone, we selected these quotes using three keywords: "gun", "shooting", "firearm" (quotes needed to contain at least one of the three in order to be selected). Later into the project, we plan to replace this basic method by a supervized learning algorithm that selects quotes that are likely to be related to the theme of our project. We could for example use a deep neural network generated with the PyTorch library.

- **Checking the relevance of the study**:<br> Plotting the distribution of the selected subset of quotes over time, and adding the occurences of shootings (from the Mother Jone's dataset), it seemed likely that there was some correlation, since we could see some peaks in quotes following the shootings. In order to check our intuition, we performed a Pearson correlation test between the number of quotes at a given date and the number of days since the last shooting.

- **Ranking features by influence on the media coverage**:<br> We plan on evaluating this by generating a "reaction score" for each shooting event. We can then perform linear regression with predictions X_i being the features of the shooting (number of fatalities, age of shooter, location, etc.), and the outcome y_i being the reaction score of event i. If we standardize the predictors using z-scores, we will then be able to compare the coefficients: the largest coefficients would correspond to the most influencial features. The tricky part that is left is to generate a "reaction score" that is accurate and truly representitive. 

- **Quantifying reaction**:<br> We believe this is one of the most - if not the most - delicate and challenging part of our study so far, since failing to properly generate this number will lead to an unreliable analysis. We will take into account several things: the number of quotes following the shooting in the next 10 days, the slope of the decrease in quotes in that period (high negative slope meaning that the media outrage quickly faded away), etc. We can then take a weighted sum of these parameters (standardized) and realisticly hope to get a meaningful score. Maybe we will learn a more accurate way of estimating such a number with Machine Learning in the next few weaks.
 
### Proposed timeline : 

1. **Mass shootings and quotes**:<br> Analyse the correlation between quotes in our subest and occurences of mass shootings<br>
a. Words set defined a-priori (already done)<br>
b. Correlation-based word set selection, and analysis (goal: done by 19.11.2021)<br>

2. **Underlying predictors**:<br> Generate reaction score and perform linear regression to rank predictors by influence, as described in the "Method" part above (goal: done by 03.12.2021)

3. **Selecting relevant quotes**: use supervised learning (manually annotate a subset of the data) to predict the link of quotes with mass shootings (goal: done by 10.12.2021)

4. **Preparing the report**: The goal is to use the last week (17.12.2021) to go through the code and add all the relevant explanitory texts and make it appealing to the reader. We believe this is a crucial part for a successfull project.
